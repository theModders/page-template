We are community of PC game modders and developers that originated within fandom of Piranha Bytes' Gothic series. We share technical knowledge, resources and constructive feedback. Everyone is welcome to engage in discussions and Q&A on our <a href="https://themodders.org">forum</a>. 

With us, players can peek into details of development of productions they like. 

Qualifying projects can get dedicated private and public discussion board, website, gallery and download mirroring on our domain.
